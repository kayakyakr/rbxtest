== RBX/EventMachine Collision

A simple rails project that shows a collision between EventMachine and
RBX > 2.5.3. This causes all interrupts and signals to fail including
ctrl+c, USR2, and QUIT.

=== Use

1. clone
2. bundle install
3. rails c
4. Try to quit. Will have to use ctrl-z or kill the server from another terminal.
